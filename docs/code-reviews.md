# Code Reviews & Collaboration

Effective code reviews improve code quality, share knowledge, and build team cohesion. They're opportunities for learning and maintaining consistency across the codebase.

## üéØ Core Principles

1. **Constructive Feedback** - Focus on the code, not the person
2. **Knowledge Sharing** - Reviews are learning opportunities for everyone
3. **Quality Assurance** - Catch bugs and improve design before deployment
4. **Team Standards** - Maintain consistency across the codebase

### Self-Review Checklist

Before requesting a review, go through your own code:

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Self-review checklist example
class UserAuthenticationService {
    // ‚úÖ Check: Method names are descriptive
    async authenticateUser(email, password) {
        try {
            // ‚úÖ Check: Input validation
            if (!email || !password) {
                throw new ValidationError('Email and password are required');
            }
            
            // ‚úÖ Check: Error handling is comprehensive
            const user = await this.findUserByEmail(email);
            if (!user) {
                throw new AuthenticationError('Invalid credentials');
            }
            
            // ‚úÖ Check: Security best practices followed
            const isValidPassword = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.hashedPassword);
            if (!isValidPassword) {
                throw new AuthenticationError('Invalid credentials');
            }
            
            // ‚úÖ Check: Logging includes necessary context
            logger.info('User authenticated successfully', {
                userId: user.id,
                email: user.email,
                timestamp: new Date()
            });
            
            return user;
            
        } catch (error) {
            // ‚úÖ Check: Errors are properly logged and re-thrown
            logger.error('Authentication failed', {
                email: email,
                error: error.message
            });
            throw error;
        }
    }
    
    // ‚úÖ Check: Private methods are marked appropriately
    async findUserByEmail(email) {
        // ‚úÖ Check: Database queries are optimized
        return await User.findOne({ email }).select('+hashedPassword');
    }
}
```

## üí¨ Providing Effective Feedback

### Constructive Review Comments

#### ‚úÖ Good: Helpful and specific feedback

```markdown
## Security Concern
Consider using a constant-time comparison here to prevent timing attacks:

// Instead of this:
if (user.secret === providedSecret) {
    // ...
}

// Use this:
if (crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(user.secret), Buffer.from(providedSecret))) {
    // ...
}

## Performance Suggestion
This loop could be optimized using a Map for O(1) lookups instead of O(n):

// Current approach O(n¬≤):
const matches = users.filter(user => 
    targetIds.some(id => id === user.id)
);

// Suggested O(n):
const targetIdSet = new Set(targetIds);
const matches = users.filter(user => targetIdSet.has(user.id));

## Code Quality
This function is doing too many things. Consider extracting the validation logic:

// Extract this:
function validateUserInput(userData) {
    if (!userData.email) throw new Error('Email required');
    if (!userData.password) throw new Error('Password required');
    if (!isValidEmail(userData.email)) throw new Error('Invalid email');
    return userData;
}

// Then use it in the main function:
function createUser(userData) {
    const validatedData = validateUserInput(userData);
    // ... rest of creation logic
}

## Question
What happens if the external API is down? Should we add retry logic or a fallback mechanism?

## Nitpick (optional)
Minor: Consider using a more descriptive variable name than `data` here. Maybe `userProfile` or `profileData`?

## Praise
Nice use of the factory pattern here! This makes the code much more testable and follows our architectural guidelines well.
```

#### ‚ùå Avoid: Unhelpful or harsh feedback

```markdown
## ‚ùå Too vague
"This is wrong."
"Fix this."
"Doesn't work."

## ‚ùå Personal attacks
"You always write code like this."
"This is terrible programming."
"Why would you do this?"

## ‚ùå Nitpicking without value
"Missing space here."
"Use single quotes instead of double quotes."
"This comment has a typo."

## ‚ùå Commands without explanation
"Use async/await."
"Don't use var."
"Add error handling."
```

### Example Review Comments

#### ‚úÖ Good: Comprehensive review feedback

```javascript
// Original code being reviewed:
async function processOrder(orderId, userId) {
    const order = await Order.findById(orderId);
    const user = await User.findById(userId);
    
    if (order.userId !== userId) {
        throw new Error('Not authorized');
    }
    
    const total = order.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
    order.total = total;
    
    await order.save();
    await emailService.sendOrderConfirmation(user.email, order);
    
    return order;
}
```

**Review Comments:**

```markdown
## üö® Security Issue
**Authorization check is insufficient** - Line 4
The authorization check only compares `order.userId !== userId` but doesn't verify that the user making the request is actually authenticated. Add proper authentication middleware.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance Concern
**N+1 query potential** - Lines 2-3
Consider fetching the order with user data in a single query to avoid multiple database hits:
```javascript
const order = await Order.findById(orderId).populate('user');
```

## üí° Code Quality Suggestion

**Error handling could be more specific** - Line 5
Instead of a generic error, use a custom error type:

```javascript
if (order.userId !== userId) {
    throw new ForbiddenError('You are not authorized to process this order');
}
```

## ‚ùì Question

**Total calculation** - Line 7
Should the total calculation include tax and shipping? The current implementation only sums item prices.

## üí° Suggestion

**Email error handling** - Line 12
What happens if the email service fails? Consider wrapping in try-catch to prevent order processing failure:

```javascript
try {
    await emailService.sendOrderConfirmation(user.email, order);
} catch (emailError) {
    logger.warn('Failed to send order confirmation', { orderId, error: emailError.message });
    // Don't fail the order processing
}
```

## üëç Good

Nice use of async/await and the reduce function for calculating totals!

## ü§ù Collaborative Practices

### Code Pairing Sessions

```markdown
## When to Pair
- Complex features or algorithms
- Learning new technologies
- Critical security implementations
- Debugging difficult issues

## Pairing Best Practices
- Switch driver/navigator every 15-30 minutes
- Think out loud to share thought process
- Take breaks every hour
- Document decisions and learnings
- Review code together before committing
```

### Knowledge Sharing

```javascript
// Example: Share architectural decisions in PRs
/**
 * Architecture Decision: Using Command Pattern for Order Processing
 * 
 * We're implementing the Command pattern here to:
 * 1. Enable undo/redo functionality for order modifications
 * 2. Allow queuing and batch processing of orders
 * 3. Provide better error handling and retry mechanisms
 * 
 * Alternative considered: Direct method calls
 * Reason for rejection: Doesn't provide the flexibility needed for future requirements
 * 
 * @see https://wiki.company.com/architecture/command-pattern
 */
class ProcessOrderCommand {
    constructor(orderId, userId) {
        this.orderId = orderId;
        this.userId = userId;
        this.timestamp = new Date();
    }
    
    async execute() {
        // Command implementation
    }
    
    async undo() {
        // Undo implementation
    }
}
```
